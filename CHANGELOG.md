and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.18.2] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- Fix Jaeger trace search returning null data — use VT-canonical field names (`"resource_attr:service.name"`, `name`, `duration`) with LogsQL quoting for colon-containing fields
- Fix loki-vl-proxy hot+cold routing — VictoriaLogs serves hot data (<24h), lakehouse-logs serves cold data via `-cold-enabled` with 1h overlap
- Add `external_query.go` patch to auto-release workflow — fixes binary build failure (`undefined: logstorage.QueryHasPipes`)
- Update e2e compose loki-vl-proxy from broken local build path to published GHCR image v1.31.2
- Format `_time` column as RFC3339Nano instead of raw nanoseconds — fixes VL handler timestamp parsing for all query endpoints
- Recover from `writeBlock` panics caused by unsupported VL pipe processors (e.g. `CountByTimePipe` in `/hits`) — prevents query crashes, returns partial results instead
- Add `filter.go` to traces module for metadata filter scoping — traces `GetFieldNames`/`GetFieldValues` now correctly apply LogsQL filters
- Apply LogsQL filter scope to metadata endpoints (`GetFieldNames`, `GetFieldValues`, `GetStreamFieldNames`, `GetStreamFieldValues`) — previously returned unfiltered results

### Changed
- Replace custom LogsQL filter parser with VL's native `Filter.MatchRow()` — full LogsQL parity including OR, AND, NOT, regex, ranges, case-insensitive matching, and all filter types VL supports
- Apply LogsQL filter evaluation in traces `RunQuery` (was missing) — traces now filter rows same as logs module
- Apply `filter` substring parameter in vlstorage adapter for `GetFieldNames`, `GetFieldValues`, `GetStreamFieldNames`, `GetStreamFieldValues` — was previously ignored, now matches VL behavior
- Improve loki-vl-proxy config for Grafana Loki Drilldown — switch to translated metadata mode, add structured metadata emission, expand stream fields (12 labels), add derived fields for trace-to-logs linking, enable patterns autodetect and label values indexed cache
- Split LOC badge into separate prod code and test code badges
- Add `GOWORK=off` to Makefile — prevents build failures from incompatible VL versions across modules

## [0.18.1] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Smart cache controller** — unified cache orchestrator wrapping L1 (memory), L2 (disk), L3 (peer), L4 (S3) with configurable TTL, hot access detection, pin tracking, and singleflight S3 deduplication (`internal/smartcache/`)
- **Cross-signal prefetch** — bidirectional hints between `lakehouse-logs` and `lakehouse-traces` deployments via HTTP (`/internal/prefetch/hint`, `/internal/cache/evict-hint`). Logs query for `service=checkout` automatically warms trace data for same time window, and vice versa (`internal/crosssignal/`)
- **LogsQL filter evaluation** — post-scan field matchers (exact, substring, regex, NOT) applied to DataBlock rows in RunQuery, ensuring cold queries respect LogsQL semantics (`internal/storage/parquets3/filter.go`)
- **max_rows enforcement** — `query.max_rows` (default 10M) caps emitted rows per query via atomic counter, preventing unbounded cold-query resource usage
- **Internal endpoint auth** — `/internal/cache/clear` and `/internal/cache/stats` require Bearer token (`peer.auth_key`) when configured, matching `/internal/manifest/update` pattern
- **Prefetch engine wiring** — cross-signal handler now creates and uses a `prefetch.Engine` to process incoming prefetch hints (was nil/inert)
- **Parallel query file workers** — configurable bounded worker pool for concurrent Parquet file processing during queries, replacing sequential file scanning (`query.file_workers`, default 8)
- **Cache sizing calculator** — adaptive cache budget estimation blending ingestion rate (early) and query pattern analysis (after 12h), with per-node fleet division (`internal/smartcache/sizing.go`)
- **Active query pinning** — files used by in-flight queries are pinned in cache with configurable grace period, preventing eviction under pressure
- **Connected data eviction** — trace IDs extracted from query results enable cross-signal cache deprioritization when traces are evicted
- **Hint batching** — cross-signal client accumulates trace ID hints and flushes on interval or batch size threshold, reducing HTTP overhead
- **Smart cache metrics** — 15 new Prometheus metrics: hit ratio, entries, bytes used/limit, evictions by reason, hot/pinned/owned entries, effective bytes, prefetch hit ratio, coverage hours
- **Cross-signal metrics** — 6 new metrics: eviction sent/received/pending/applied, prefetch sent/received
- Smart cache snapshot persistence — periodic metadata snapshots to disk for fast cache warmup on restart
- Smart cache eviction loop — background TTL enforcement with hot access detection and pin protection

### Changed
- `getFileData()` in storage now routes through SmartCacheController when available, with fallback to original L1→L2→L3→S3 chain
- `RunQuery` wraps `writeBlock` callback with filter evaluation, tombstone filtering, and max_rows enforcement before passing to caller
- `RunQuery` uses parallel file worker pool instead of sequential processing
- `queryFile` extracts trace IDs from result DataBlocks for prefetch and cross-signal hints
- Both `lakehouse-logs` and `lakehouse-traces` binaries wire up cross-signal handlers with active prefetch engine, eviction loop, and snapshot persistence
- Auto-release workflow now auto-merges metadata PRs to prevent version drift

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Query rate limiting via `MaxConcurrent` semaphore — returns HTTP 429 when at capacity
- S3 retry with exponential backoff for all S3 operations (`ReadAt`, `Upload`, `Download`, `Delete`, `Exists`)
- Context propagation in S3 reader (replaces `context.TODO()`)
- Per-operation S3 metrics (requests, duration, errors, bytes read)
- Slow query logging with configurable threshold and query duration histograms
- VL/VT integration stubs: `GetStreamIDs`, `GetTenantIDs`, delete dispatch (`DeleteRunTask`/`DeleteStopTask`/`DeleteActiveTasks`)
- Tests: s3reader (Upload/Download/Delete/Exists), election (S3/K8s/auto), Jaeger handlers, selectapi, vlstorage adapters, S3 retry (+112 tests)
- Helm: `NOTES.txt` post-install guidance, `NetworkPolicy` template, `values.schema.json` validation
- CI: golangci-lint v2 config, Dependabot for Go/Actions/Docker, hardened security workflow
- Project logo

### Changed
- Replace custom `internalselect` handler (~960 lines) with VL's built-in `RequestHandler` for both modules
- Split `parquets3/storage.go` (1,383 lines) into `storage_query.go` and `storage_fields.go`
- Extract Jaeger handlers (~560 lines) from `handler.go` into dedicated `jaeger.go`

### Removed
- Dead code: empty `UpdatePerQueryStatsMetrics()`, unused `CircuitBreakerConfig`, `S3CircuitBreakerState` metric

### Fixed
- Replace custom internalselect encoding with VL's actual wire format — fixes vlselect panics (`growslice: len out of range`) caused by 4-byte uint32 block lengths instead of 8-byte uint64
- Add `internal/vlstorage/` thin dispatch layer bridging `storage.Storage` to VL's vlstorage function signatures (both logs and traces)
- Remove protocol-incompatible vlselect service from E2E compose
- Remove orphaned vlselect Grafana datasource pointing to removed service
- Fix traces-to-logs datasource uid reference (`victoria-lakehouse-logs` → `victoria-lakehouse-cold`)
- Delete dead `internal/protocol/` package in both logs and traces modules (replaced by VL encoding in #28)

### Architecture
- Split into two separate binaries: `lakehouse-logs` and `lakehouse-traces`
- Each binary has its own Go module with independent VL dependency versions
- Logs pins to VL v1.50.0, Traces pins to VL commit a408207c2242 (VT v0.8.2 compatible)
- Removed unified `cmd/lakehouse/` binary and `--lakehouse.mode` flag — mode is hardcoded per binary

### Logs (`lakehouse-logs`)
- Separate Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.logs`), Docker image (`ghcr.io/.../lakehouse-logs`)
- Default port `:9428`, bloom columns: `[service.name]`
- Delete API at `/delete/logsql/*`
- Mode-specific config section: `logs:` in YAML, `--lakehouse.logs.*` flags

### Traces (`lakehouse-traces`)
- Separate Go module (`lakehouse-traces/go.mod`) with VT-compatible VL dependency
- Separate Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.traces`), Docker image (`ghcr.io/.../lakehouse-traces`)
- Default port `:10428`, bloom columns: `[trace_id, service.name]`
- Delete API at `/delete/tracessql/*`
- Jaeger gRPC support: `--lakehouse.traces.jaeger-enabled`, `--lakehouse.traces.jaeger-grpc-addr`
- Mode-specific config section: `traces:` in YAML, `--lakehouse.traces.*` flags

### Shared
- Mode-specific config extension points (`logs:` / `traces:` sections) with accessor methods (`ActiveBloomColumns()`, `ActiveDeletePrefix()`, `ActiveCompatVersion()`)
- Discovery `defaultPort` parameter for mode-aware SRV resolution (9428 for logs, 10428 for traces)
- Helm chart: mode-aware image selection (`image.logs.repository` / `image.traces.repository`)
- CI: Fully parallel jobs for logs and traces (test, lint, build, docker, security, benchmarks)

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `/lakehouse/info` endpoint now includes `build_time` field for operational visibility
- Traces delete support: mode-aware rewriter uses `schema.TraceRow` for traces mode, `schema.LogRow` for logs mode
- Delete handler registers at `/delete/tracessql/*` in traces mode, `/delete/logsql/*` in logs mode
- Docs: 5 new pages for Docusaurus site — read-path, kubernetes-deployment, docker-compose-setup, benchmarks, open-parquet-format
- Docs: Docusaurus YAML frontmatter on all 20 documentation pages
- CI: Changelog enforcement workflow — PRs with releasable changes require `[Unreleased]` entry

### Fixed
- Docs: Corrected false VL/VT compatibility claims — replaced "imports as Go module dependencies" with accurate "reimplements the VL/VT storage interface" (codebase is 100% clean-room, zero VL/VT Go imports)
- Docs: Removed non-existent `/insert/opentelemetry/v1/logs` endpoint from write-path documentation
- Docs: M7 Observability milestone updated from "Planned" to "Complete"
- Docs: Config count corrected from "65+ flags" to "110+ config options" (verified from code)

### Changed
- Docs: All cost tables corrected for 3 AZ replication (VL/VT runs 3 identical clusters, one per AZ)
- Docs: At 500GB/day 1yr 3 AZ — VL/VT $2,679/mo, Lakehouse $2,814/mo (within 5%), Loki $3,610/mo
- Docs: Compute scaled to 6× per component (3 AZ), storage × 3 for EBS, break-even and cumulative projections updated

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
